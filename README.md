## Project Description

This is a Repo for our Project Museum of Imagination at Holberton Tulsa. The theme choosen for our web museum is "A surreal cityscape where buildings defy gravity" so we are making a web museum site with a virtual journey through a city where creativity knows no bounds, and architectural wonders defy the laws of physics. </p>

## Requirements

Imagine that you have been commissioned to create a stunning online experience for the “Museum of the Imagination.” This museum is dedicated to celebrating human creativity, innovation, and artistic expression. Your task is to design and develop a responsive website that embodies the essence of imagination and showcases a variety of imaginative artworks.

The “Museum of the Imagination” has provided you with a collection of imaginative artworks, each represented by a one-sentence description. You can choose any of these sentences as your starting point for designing a webpage that best suits the artwork’s unique characteristics. You have the creative freedom to decide how you want to visually represent these artworks and present them to the virtual museum’s visitors.

Here are a few example sentences you can choose from:

“A world within a snow globe, bustling with miniature life.”
“A garden where flowers bloom in tune with music.”
“An enchanted forest where trees whisper secrets.”
“A surreal cityscape where buildings defy gravity.”
“A clockwork wonderland filled with fantastical contraptions.”
Your challenge is to create a captivating and immersive web experience that showcases the chosen artwork, conveys the essence of each description, and sparks the visitors’ imagination. Whether it’s through interactive animations, parallax scrolling, or unique navigation, the goal is to transport visitors into the realm of imagination.
